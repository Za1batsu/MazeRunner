# CustomTab
Replace your new tab page with whatever you want! (Chrome Extension)

## Installation
Clone the repo, doesn't matter where. 

Open up chrome and go to your extensions page (chrome://extensions/)

Check the box that says "Developer Mode"

You should now see a button that says "Load unpacked extension..."

Click it, and select the root folder of CustomTab to enable it.

## Changing themes

Upon installing CustomTab, the theme is set to Default. 
To change this, simply open the index.html in the root folder and 
replace the word on line 4 with your theme of choice.

The current themes available are:
* Default
* Mazerunner

## Making your own theme

Making your own theme for CustomTab is stupidly simple.

In the root CustomTab folder, make a new folder with the name of your choice, 
and drop an index.html in there and change your theme (using the instructions above)
to get started. 

It's just like your typical project directory, you can structure it
to your liking, take a look at the current themes to get an idea.

And lastly,

#### Submit your theme as a pull request!

I want this project to populate with all sorts of custom tab pages, so help me out!
